  - Options:
    - [ ] JSON file storage (quick dev solution)
    - [ ] SQLite database (better for development)
    - [ ] MongoDB/PostgreSQL (production-ready)
  - Priority: HIGH

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Backend in-memory storage**
   - Users are lost on backend restart
   - Need persistent storage implementation
   - Workaround: Keep backend running during development

2. **Rate limiter cleanup**
   - Rate limiter stores grow indefinitely
   - Need TTL-based cleanup or Redis
   - Current: Manual cleanup every 60s

## üìù Notes

- Backend uses JWT for authentication
- Frontend uses AsyncStorage for token persistence
- Rate limiting is email-based for login, IP-based for other endpoints
- All screens use CustomAlert instead of native Alert
- Expo Go requires IP address for API URL (not localhost)

**Last Task Completed:** Email-based rate limiting for auth endpoints
**Next Task:** Implement persistent user storage (JSON file)
