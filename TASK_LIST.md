## üêõ Known Issues

1. **MongoDB connection required**
   - Backend requires MongoDB Atlas connection string or local MongoDB instance
   - Setup: Add MONGODB_URI to backend/.env file
   - Options: MongoDB Atlas (cloud, recommended) or local installation

2. **Rate limiter cleanup**
   - Rate limiter stores grow indefinitely
   - Need TTL-based cleanup or Redis
   - Current: Manual cleanup every 60s
